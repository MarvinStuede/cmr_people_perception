# **cmr_bt_people**: Behavior Tree nodes
This package contains some nodes and conditions to use in a [Behavior Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)) created with the [BehaviorTree.CPP library](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP).

## How to use
The file `cmr_bt_people_tree_nodes.xml` contains the `.xml` definition of the nodes with a short description. You can add these nodes to Groot via the `Load palette from file` function.
The nodes are compiled as shared libraries to use as a dynamic plugin.  Check the [examples in BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/tree/master/examples) on how to use those plugins.
